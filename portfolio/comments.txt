Comment: hello! a little QoL request.. Can you make smoke remember the vision range even if it have "Unlimited vision range" active? I noted that if you set a vision to infinite and than refresh the tab Smoke! set the default range to 30 ft even if you have setted it to another number.

Comment: Sweet sweet thanks for that. Currently new to looking at Owlbear 2.0 so seeing all the extensions and integrations is both awesome but equally confusing as all hell

Comment: one tiny request for Scry! - could you make the popover semi-transparent (maybe a toggle?) so that you can see more of the scene (ie. through it) when on mobile, please?
